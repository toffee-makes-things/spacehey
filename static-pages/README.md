# What is this?
I want to use spacehey as a personal website, because it has a lot of what i would want already available by default, but there is no feature to make a static page, well... except blog posts

In spacehey you can add HTML customizations to a blog post & make the blog post "link only" so the blog post does not show up as a blog post on your profile or on spacehey as a whole and is only accessible if you have the link,

So you can sorta use it as a static webpage
